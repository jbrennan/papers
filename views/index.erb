	This is some body text that goes in a paragraph. I'm trying to determine what the main text font size should be but it's hard to say at this point. I need to write some text to see what it's actually going to look like. I also want to make sure the text doesn't get all silly and spill all over the place. Technically, I could think of the document titles as the default font sizes, but I think those are more like headers to me.
