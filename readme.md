papers
======

A crappy lil (unfinished) web app for uploading / cataloguing pdf papers. I never got around to finishing it (it barely functions).

Installation
------------

You should have `bundler` installed. In that case, just do `bundle install` after you've cloned and changed into the project's directory.
